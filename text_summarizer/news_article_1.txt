External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Tuesday informed the Rajya Sabha that the 39 Indians, who had been abducted in Iraq in 2014, are dead.

In her suo motu statement in Parliament, Ms. Swaraj said that while it was not immediately known when the Indians were killed, their bodies had been recovered from a mound in Badush, around 30 km from Mosul. The identities of the deceased were established after the bodies were exhumed from a mass grave and matched with DNA samples collected from family members in September last year.

Strands of long hair, a kada (metal bangle worn by Sikhs), a few ID cards and shoes, which were not of Iraqi brands, were also recovered from the mound after the bodies were exhumed, the Minister said. The help of the Martyr’s Foundation, an Iraqi government-run agency, was sought to establish the identity of the deceased, she said.

Minister of State for External Affairs V.K. Singh would travel to Iraq to bring back the mortal remains of the Indians, she said.

“I had said I would not declare anyone dead without substantive proof. I had said that whenever I got proof, I would first inform Parliament if it was in session or apprise the country within 10 minutes on Twitter. Today, I have come to fulfil that commitment. I had said that closure would be done with full proof. And when we will, with a heavy heart, give the mortal remains to their kin, it will be a kind of closure,” Ms. Swaraj told Rajya Sabha.

The group of 40 Indian workers, mostly from Punjab, and some Bangladeshis were taken hostage by fighters of the Islamic State (IS) when the outfit captured Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, in 2014. A member of the group, Harjit Masih from Gurdaspur, managed to escape to Erbil and contacted Indian authorities. He later claimed that the other hostages were taken to a jungle, lined up and shot dead. The government had then rejected his claims.
